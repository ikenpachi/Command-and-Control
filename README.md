# HarpiaC2 - Brazilian Command and Control Framework ðŸ¦…

This repository contains a Python-based proof of concept (PoC) for a lightweight and stealthy Command and Control (C2) framework named **HarpiaC2**.

It demonstrates how a bot client can connect to a central operator (C2 server), receive remote shell commands, execute them on the infected machine, and return the output securely.

---

## Concept

**HarpiaC2** simulates a real-world **Command and Control** scenario â€” typically used in **Red Team operations** and **botnet control structures**. Bots (clients) connect to the C2 server and await instructions.

- The **server** listens for incoming bot connections.
- The **bot client** connects, authenticates via a secure key exchange, and awaits OS-level commands.

Once connected, operators can interact with bots, execute shell commands remotely, and receive results in real time.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Socket Programming (`socket`)
- Command Execution (`subprocess`)
- Secure AES Encryption with DH Key Exchange (`cryptography`)
- ANSI Coloring with `colorama`

## Project Structure

```bash
HarpiaC2/
â”œâ”€â”€ multi_c2_server.py       # Main C2 controller (multi-bot)
â”œâ”€â”€ bot_client.py            # Bot implant/client
â”œâ”€â”€ c2_console.py            # Legacy console (single bot mode)
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands.py          # System info and command execution
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aes_crypto.py        # AES encryption layer

```

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Server
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python multi_c2_server.py
```

### 2. Deploy a Bot Client
On another machine or terminal, run:
```bash
python bot_client.py
```

The bot will connect automatically, perform key exchange, and await commands.
